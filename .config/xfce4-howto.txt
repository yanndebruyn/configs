there's a caveat: some of the files are overwritten by xfce even if you don't
select the "Save session" when logging out. Also, some of the files are loaded
in Xfconf and they're not refreshed until you restart.

Because of that, please follow the steps:

- Log out of xfce before copying the files
- Copy the files from the terminal (CTRL-ALT-F1)
- Make sure the proper permissions are set on copied files (they should belong to
   wanted user; if not, do chown -R user:group .config/xfce4)
- Then restart the computer (do not relogin immediately, but restart)
